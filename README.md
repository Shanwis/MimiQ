A lightweight, modern C++ library for simulating quantum circuits. This project provides a core QuantumCircuit class to build, manipulate, and measure N-qubit systems. It is capable of simulating both superposition and entanglement using a full state vector representation.

The repository also includes a command-line application that serves as a demonstration of the library's features.


## Features

* **Core C++ Library**: A self-contained set of classes of quantum simulation that can be easily integrated into your own C++ projects :) .
* **N-Qubit Simulation**: Simulate a quantum system with any number of qubits ($N$).
* **State Vector Model**: Uses a single state vector of $2^N$ complex amplitudes to accurately model entanglement and superposition.
* **Rich Gate Set (there is more to add honetly)**:
    * **Single-Qubit**: Hadamard (H), Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, Pauli-Z, Phase (S), T and T-dagger.
    * **Multi-Qubit**: Controlled-NOT (CNOT)
* **Circuit Visualization**: Renders an ASCII diagram of the circuit you've built.
* **Probability Graph**: Creates a GNUplot for showing the probablility graphs for the circuit created.
* **Three Measurement Modes**:
    1.  **Probabilistic**: Display the probabilities of all possible outcomes.
    2. **State vectors**: Display the state vector.
    2.  **Collapse**: Simulate a real measurement by collapsing the wave function to a single, definite state.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
* A modern C++ compiler (C++11 or later), such as g++, Clang, or MSVC.

* The make build automation tool.

* GNUplot installed and added to your PATH.

### Installation & Setup
**On Linux & macOS**

On most Linux distributions and macOS, g++ and make are either pre-installed or can be easily installed through your system's package manager.

**On Debian/Ubuntu**: 
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt install gnuplot
```

**On macOS**: Install the Command Line Tools by running xcode-select --install in your terminal.

**On Windows**:
Windows does not come with make or g++ by default. The recommended way to get them is by installing MSYS2, which provides a complete GNU development environment.

Download and install MSYS2 from the official website: https://www.msys2.org/

After installation, open the MSYS2 MINGW64 shell from the Start Menu.

Install the make and g++ toolchain by running the following command in the shell:
```
pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
```

(Optional but recommended) Add the MinGW-w64 bin folder to your Windows PATH environment variable to run make and g++ from any terminal (like PowerShell or Command Prompt). The path is typically C:\msys64\mingw64\bin.

Go to SourceForge abd install GNUPlot and add to the environment variables. 


### Build and Run
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Shanwis/Quantum-Computer-Simulator.git](https://github.com/Shanwis/Quantum-Computer-Simulator.git)
    cd Quantum-Computer-Simulator
    ```

2.  **Run the make file**
    ```bash
    make
    make run
    ```
3. **After use**
    ```bash
    make clean
    ```
## Usage

Once the program is running, it will first ask for the number of qubits you want to simulate. After that, you will be presented with the main menu.

```
--- Menu ---
1. Apply Gate
2. Display Circuit
3. Measure State(Collapses)
4. Print State Vector (Debug)
5. Print probabilities (Debug)
6. Display probability graph
7. Display Heat Map
8. Exit
Your choice:
```

Simply enter the number corresponding to the action you want to take. When applying gates, the program will prompt you for the gate type and the target/control qubits.

## Example: Creating a Bell State (Entanglement)

Here's how to create the famous entangled Bell state $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle)$:

1.  Start the simulator with **2 qubits**.
2.  Choose option **1. Apply Gate**, then apply an **H** gate to qubit **0**.
3.  Choose option **1. Apply Gate** again, then apply a **C** (CNOT) gate with control qubit **0** and target qubit **1**.
4.  Choose option **2. Display Circuit**. The output will be:
    ```
    --- Circuit Diagram ---
    q0: -[H]--[C]-
    q1: ------[âŠ•]-
    -----------------------
    ```
5.  Choose option **5. Print probabilities (Debug)**. The output will show the classic signature of entanglement:
    ```
    --- State Probabilities ---
    Probability of |00>: 0.500000
    Probability of |11>: 0.500000
    ---------------------------
    ```
6. Choose option **6. Display probability graph** The output will show the graph with probability:

![Probability graph for bell state](./photos/graphusinggnuplot.png)

This result demonstrates that a measurement will yield either `|00>` or `|11>` with equal probability, but never `|01>` or `|10>`. The fates of the two qubits are linked!
